Who is it for?
--------------

QR codes are quite robust to corruption so that they still work when they are a bit dirty or there is light reflecting etc. People have taken advantage of this by sticking logos over the middle.

This project takes that to the next level by allowing you to easily toggle specific pixels on and off. This offers the following advantages:

* Ensures the QR code is still valid
* Optimize you design around natural shapes in the QR code
* Visually bigger logos can be drawn
* They look awesome
